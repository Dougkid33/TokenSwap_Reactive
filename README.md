# TokenSwap_Reactive
A simple dApp for automated token swapping, built during a hackathon for educational purposes. The project uses Next.js for the front-end and Node.js with Ethers.js for the back-end, connected to Ethereum via Infura. The goal is to demonstrate token swapping functionality using smart contracts and blockchain integration.
